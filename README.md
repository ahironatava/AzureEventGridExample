# AzureEventGridExample
This repository provides the materials for the first of three sessions that will provide a deep dive on Event-Driven architecture and the role that Azure Event Grid and Event Hub can play. The sessions go “under the hood” and share example implementations that you can deploy and experiment with for potential “building blocks” in future work. They also share lessons learned from a MVP that included both Azure Event Grid and Event Hub, explaining design choices and some tips for debugging

This repository is intended to serve as an introduction to Azure Event Grid, using a Proof-of-Concept event-driven, publish-subscribe example.

The PDF file provides some background theory, then introduces the PoC, the source code used, the steps to construct the PoC and then some debugging tips.
